# Probabilistic-Reasoning
A software application designed to solve medical diagnostic problems by performing probabilistic reasoning from data.

## Structure Learning
This application offers two options for generating a structure for the given data:
- Naive structure generation
- PC-Stable structure learning

Both of these options utilise the `networkx` library to manage the structure of the directed acyclic graphs and the nodes within.
